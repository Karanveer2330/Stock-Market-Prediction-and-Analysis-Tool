Overview
The Stock Market Prediction and Analysis Tool is a powerful application designed to provide comprehensive insights into stock market trends and future movements. By integrating advanced machine learning models with real-time data visualization, it aims to assist users in making more informed investment decisions.
Features
* Stock Movement Prediction (Random Forest): Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict the likely direction of stock price movements (e.g., up, down, stable).
* Future Stock Price Forecasting (LSTM): Employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future stock prices, capturing complex temporal dependencies in time-series data.
* Real-time Stock Data Visualization: Offers an interactive and dynamic dashboard for visualizing real-time stock data, including candlestick charts, volume, and various technical indicators.
* Trend Forecasting (Facebook Prophet): Leverages Facebook Prophet to identify and project underlying trends and seasonal patterns in stock prices.
* Integrated Accounting Data & News: Displays essential accounting data (e.g., financial statements, key ratios) and relevant news articles to provide fundamental and qualitative insights alongside technical analysis.
Getting Started
System Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS (latest versions), Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
* Python Version: Python 3.8+
* RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended for optimal performance)
* Storage: 2GB free space minimum
* Internet Connection: Required for real-time data retrieval and API access.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
cd [Your Project Directory Name]

2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file generated from your development environment containing all necessary libraries.)
Configuration
API Keys
The application requires API keys for accessing various data sources. Please obtain your API keys from the respective providers (e.g., Alpha Vantage for stock data, NewsAPI for news, Financial Modeling Prep for accounting data).
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your API keys as follows:
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY
NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY
FMP_API_KEY=YOUR_FMP_API_KEY
# Add other API keys as needed

Usage
Running the Application
After installation and configuration, run the application using:
python app.py  # Or the name of your main application file

The application will typically launch a web interface, which you can access in your browser (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:8501).


Navigating the Dashboard
The dashboard is designed for intuitive interaction and is divided into several key areas:
   * Stock Selection: Use the search bar to enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL) and select a historical date range for analysis.
   * Real-time Stock Data Visualization: View interactive charts including candlestick, volume, moving averages, and other technical indicators, updated dynamically.
   * Stock Movement Prediction: See the predicted direction of the stock's movement (e.g., "Likely to go Up") along with a confidence score, powered by the Random Forest model.
   * Future Stock Price Forecasting: Observe a chart displaying forecasted future stock prices for a specified horizon, generated by the LSTM model.
   * Trend Forecasting: Analyze the underlying trend and seasonality components of the stock price, as identified by Facebook Prophet.
   * Accounting Data: Access key financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) and important financial ratios for the selected company.
   * Relevant News: Browse a feed of the latest news headlines and summaries related to the stock.

     
Technical Details
Data Sources
   * Historical Stock Data: Sourced from reliable financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
   * Real-time Data: Fetched from real-time stock data providers (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data).
   * Accounting Data: Retrieved from comprehensive financial data APIs (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
   * News Data: Obtained from news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, GNews API).

     
Machine Learning Models
   * Random Forest (for Stock Movement Prediction): A robust ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting. Features include lagged prices, volume, and various technical indicators.
   * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network (for Future Stock Price Forecasting): A specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it highly effective for time series prediction. It processes sequences of historical stock prices to forecast future values.
   * Facebook Prophet (for Trend Forecasting): An open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook, designed for forecasting univariate time series data. It decomposes time series into trend, seasonality, and holiday components, providing intuitive and customizable forecasts.
Architecture (High-Level)


The application typically follows a client-server architecture:
   * Frontend: Handles the user interface and interactive data visualizations (e.g., built with Streamlit, Flask with HTML/CSS/JS, or Dash).
   * Backend: Manages data retrieval from external APIs, processes data, performs machine learning model inference, and serves data to the frontend.
   * Model Persistence: Trained machine learning models are saved and loaded to enable efficient prediction without retraining on every run.
